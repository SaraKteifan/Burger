# Burger
In this repository I am designing a _responsive Burger_ using HTML and CSS **Only**.

### The following CSS techniques were used in order to make the design responsive:
- The body is set to be **grid-based** layout.
- The burger container is set to be a **Flexbox**.
- Media queries were used to adjust the burger for different screen sizes.
